# Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems! Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. By working through these problems, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of various algorithms and mathematical concepts.

## Structure

Each problem is solved in a separate folder, which includes:
- The problem statement (if applicable).
- My solution, usually written in [Python](https://www.python.org/).
- Any additional notes or comments explaining the approach taken.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the solutions. Each folder is named according to the problem number on the Project Euler website, making it easy to match the code to the problem. You can clone this repository and run the solutions on your local machine.

### Example

To run a solution:
1. Navigate to the folder containing the problem you are interested in.
2. Run the code using your preferred compiler or interpreter.

```bash
# Example for a Python solution
cd project_euler
python problem_01.py
```
